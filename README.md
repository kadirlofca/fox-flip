## 🦊 Fox Flip

You are a **very unlucky fox**, and the only way to win is to **cheat your way to victory** in this game of luck.

The board game itself is simple — so simple that you can **observe and learn it directly from your opponent**.

But be careful:  
your opponent can get distracted.  
**Read their body language. Exploit the moment. Win.**
